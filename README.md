# Data-structures
Welcome to the **Data Structures** repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Java. The purpose of this repository is to provide clear, well-documented implementation for data structures for educational purposes.

## Implemented data structures
### ArrayList 
- An array list is considered to be a dynamic array and implemented using an array.

### Linked List
- Singly Linked List: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element, known as a node, contains a data part and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

### Stack
- Stack (Linked List-based): A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out **(LIFO)** principle.

### Queue
- Queue (Linked List-based): A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out **(FIFO)** principle.

### Trees
- Binary Tree: A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.
- Binary Search Tree **(BST)** : A Binary Search Tree is a type of binary tree where each node has a comparable key and satisfies the following properties:
  - The key in each node is greater than all keys in the node's left subtree.
  - The key in each node is less than all keys in the node's right subtree. 
- AVL Tree: AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree (BST).

### Heaps
- Heap: The binary heap data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree , The tree is completely filled on all levels *except possibly the lowest*, which is filled from the left up to a point.
- Max-Heap: The key at the root must be the maximum among all keys present in the heap. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees.

### Priority Queue
- In a priority queue, elements are assigned with priorities. When accessing elements, the element with the highest priority is removed first, I used **Max-Heap** to implement priority queue.

### Hash Table
- Hash-Map: Hashing is a technique that retrieves the value using the index obtained from the key without performing a search, Here i used Open Addressing **Double Hashing** for handling collisions.

### Graph
- Adjacency List-based: A graph is a collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges (or arcs) that connect pairs of nodes. 
- Graph Traversal (BFS, DFS): The most common algorithms for graph traversal.
